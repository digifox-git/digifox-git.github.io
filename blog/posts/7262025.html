										<p><font size="+1"><b>Welcome to My Blog</b></font></p>
										<p>Hello! I've got a few new things to share that I've been working on for a little while. There's quite a bit to cover, so I won't waste your time with a lengthy introduction.</p>
										<p><font size="+1"><b>New Hit Counter</b></font></p>
										<p>A Hit Counter has been added to the website! You've probably seen it already, but incase you didn't, you can find it at the bottom left of most pages :) <br>...I would say <i>all</i> pages, but I'm sure I've forgotten it somewhere.</p>
										<p><font size="+1"><b>New Project</b></font></p>
										<p>I'm happy to share some new projects I've made. The first one is <b>Search</b>, and it can be found on the Projects page. Admittedly this one was just for me, but you might get some use out of it too! I was getting pretty bored of the default Firefox "New Tab" page, so I made my own to replace it. Now that I think about it, custom backgrounds and logos would make this a lot more useful to people other than me... One day!<br><br>Side Note: Because of how I've decided to store your preference on the page's epilepsy warning, I'll need to add a settings page sometime soon to make it easier to change/view your data. Don't worry, though, everything you do is in your browser's Local Storage, so I don't have access to any of it!</p>                                        
										<p><font size="+1"><b>New Page</b></font></p>
										<p>I've thought a lot about the Chat page. More specifically, I've thought a lot about how I don't really care for it. So I'll be replacing it soon! I won't share what I'm replacing it with just yet, but I hope you'll come back every so often to check...</p>                                        
										<p><font size="+1"><b>Unfinished Business</b></font></p>
										<p>You may or may not have noticed that the Top 10 Gamez page is still incomplete. I know! I'm sorry!! I'm really good at procrastinating!!! Honestly, though I will get to it eventually, It's going to be quite a bit of work to get it done. Most of the work will be because of the individual reviews I'll have to write for each game, even though I plan to keep them relatively short. Thinking is hard!<br>It will be done eventually, though. Probably. We'll see!!</p>                                        
                                    	<p><font size="+1"><b>The End</b></font></p>
                                        <p>That's about everything! I hope you enjoyed this little update as much as I did. If you're excited to see any future updates, follow me on Neocities by clicking the little "Follow me on Neocities!" button at the bottom of your page. I've still got tons of stuff planned, so stay tuned!!</p>
